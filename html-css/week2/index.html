                <p>Example of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce
                    led by web deb development include e-com-merce. Online auction
                    sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and
                    purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com
                    and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and
                    bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.</p>

                <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a
                    growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
                    businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and
                    services to customers.[1]</p><br>

                <p>There is open source of software for web development like
                    berkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and
                    Perl?Plack. This has kept the cost of growth of the industry has
                    been the rise of easy-to use WYSIWYG web web-development software,
                    such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.
                    Knowledge of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
                    languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can
                    be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help files,
                    technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face training.</p><br>

                <p>an ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers
                    build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers
                    now help to deliver applications as web services which were
                    traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based
                    computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize
                    information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the
                    rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and
                    Google Docs.These web services allow users to interact with
                    applications form many locations, web services allow users to
                    interact with applications from many locations, instead of being
                    tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.</p>
